# Housing-Price

Machine Learning-Based Housing Pricing Recommendation System
A full ML pipeline built with Scikit-Learn to recommend fair housing prices using historical market trends. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation wrapped inside an end-to-end Scikit-Learn pipeline. Ideal for buyers and sellers looking to estimate realistic housing values.


# 🏡 Machine Learning-Based Housing Pricing Recommendation System

A machine learning project designed to assist **home buyers and sellers** in identifying **fair market prices** based on historical housing data. The project uses **Scikit-Learn pipelines** to build a clean, modular, and efficient ML workflow—from preprocessing to prediction.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Housing prices depend on multiple factors such as location, size, number of rooms, economic conditions, and historical trends.  
This project builds an end-to-end ML recommendation system that:

- Cleans and preprocesses raw housing data  
- Performs feature engineering  
- Trains multiple ML models using Scikit-Learn pipelines  
- Evaluates model performance  
- Generates price recommendations for given property attributes

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Joblib** (for model persistence)
